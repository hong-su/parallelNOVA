A variant of NOVA filesystem optimized for a parallel write to a single file

# parallelNOVA: Parallel NOn-Volatile memory Accelerated log-structured file system

ParallelNOVA is a variance of [NOVA][NOVA]. It aims to parallelize simultaneous writes to a same file using [range rwlock][RANGERWLOCK] by allowing multiple threads that perform write to mutually exclusive ranges. ParallelNOVA is under development by the [Distributed and Cloud Computing Laboratory][DCC] in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering][CS] at the [Sogang University, Seoul, Korea][SG].
